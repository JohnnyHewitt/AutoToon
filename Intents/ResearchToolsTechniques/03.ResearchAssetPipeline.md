# 3. Research Asset Pipeline

**Goal**: How do AI-generated assets (characters, backgrounds, props) get into the chosen tool? File formats, import workflows, style consistency, asset organization.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: 01

## Steps
- [x] Identify supported import formats for top candidate tools
- [x] Research AI asset generation approaches (style-consistent characters, backgrounds, props)
- [x] Map the pipeline: AI generation → format conversion → tool import → asset library
- [x] Evaluate asset organization and reuse strategies

## Definition of Done
- [x] Asset pipeline documented end-to-end
- [x] File format requirements clear
- [x] Style consistency approach identified

## Findings

### Blender GP Import Formats
- SVG (vector — good for clean-line cartoon assets)
- PNG/TIFF/PSD (raster — good for AI-generated images)
- Native .blend files (best for reuse via asset library)

### Asset Pipeline (high level)
```
AI generates asset (image/vector)
  → Convert to SVG or import as GP strokes via Python API
  → Save as .blend with asset metadata + tags
  → Deposit into tenant's asset library folder
  → Any project links to assets from the library
```

### Asset Organization
- Blender Asset Browser: folder-based, catalog system, taggable, Python-scriptable
- `bpy.types.AssetMetaData`, `AssetTag`, `AssetRepresentation` for programmatic management
- Catalogs defined via `blender_assets.cats.txt` per library folder

### Multi-Tenant (Phase III)
- Each customer = separate asset library folder
- No cross-linking between tenants
- Straightforward since Blender libraries are just folder paths
- AI pipeline scopes to one tenant folder per session

### Style Consistency
- To be explored further in Phase II — likely a combination of:
  - AI model fine-tuning or LoRA per project style
  - Style guide constraints in prompts
  - Post-processing to normalize line weight, color palette

## Outcome
- **Actual Time**: ~30 min
- **Result**: Blender's folder-based asset library with Python API access supports the pipeline. SVG import for vector assets, .blend files for reusable rigged assets. Tenant isolation via separate folders. Style consistency deferred to Phase II.
- **Follow-ups**: Phase II — implement actual asset generation pipeline; Phase III — tenant isolation architecture
