# 4. Research Storyboard Workflow

**Goal**: How to manage storyboards — from AI-generated panels to sequenced scenes. Tools, formats, and how storyboards translate into animation timelines.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: 01

## Steps
- [x] Research storyboard tools and formats used in 2D animation
- [x] Evaluate AI-assisted storyboard generation approaches
- [x] Define how storyboards map to animation scenes and timelines
- [x] Identify integration points with the chosen animation tool

## Definition of Done
- [x] Storyboard workflow documented from concept to animation timeline
- [x] Tools and formats identified
- [x] Integration path with animation tool clear

## Findings

### Existing Tools Evaluated
- **Storypencil** (Blender addon) — broken in Blender 5.0, no script/asset awareness
- **Storyboarder** (open source) — Fountain script import, but unmaintained since ~2019
- **StoryLiner** (paid Blender addon) — no script-to-panel automation
- **AI storyboard generators** (Boords, Katalist, etc.) — SaaS, no asset awareness, no Blender integration

### Key Finding: No existing tool does what we need
None of the evaluated tools connect script → assets → storyboard panels → Blender scenes. This is the core product differentiator for AutoToon.

### Decision: Build Custom (Phase II)

Storyboard/script is **90% data management, 10% visual**. Custom system with MCP will handle:

**Data layer (the core):**
- Script ingestion (Fountain format — plain-text, easy to parse, industry standard)
- Scene/panel decomposition (AI parses action, dialogue, characters, settings)
- Entity resolution (match script references to asset library — "Alice" → `asset_alice_v2.blend`)
- Sequencing and timeline (panel order, scene breaks, timing)
- Shot metadata (camera angle, framing, transitions)

**Visual layer (rendering of data):**
- Panel composition generated from scene data + assets
- Rough layouts via AI or template-based placement
- Panels pushed to Blender as sequenced scenes via Python API
- Each scene pre-loaded with correct character/background assets

### Architecture (high level)
```
Script (Fountain/custom)
  → AI parses into scenes + panels (data)
  → Each panel: {characters, action, dialogue, setting, camera}
  → Entity resolution against asset library
  → Panel sequence → Blender scenes via bpy
  → Each scene pre-loaded with linked assets
```

### Script Format
Fountain (https://fountain.io/) — plain-text screenplay format. Easy to parse, widely used. Good starting point; may extend with custom metadata for animation-specific needs.

## Outcome
- **Actual Time**: ~30 min
- **Result**: No off-the-shelf solution exists. Will build custom storyboard/script management system in Phase II. This is the core product differentiator — an MCP-enabled data management layer that connects script → assets → Blender scenes.
- **Follow-ups**: Phase II — design and build storyboard data model + MCP tools
