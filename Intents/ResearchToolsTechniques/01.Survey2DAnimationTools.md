# 1. Survey 2D Animation Tools

**Goal**: Identify and compare 2D animation tools (OpenToonz, Synfig, Pencil2D, Krita, Blender Grease Pencil, Toon Boom, Moho, etc.). Evaluate: quality, scriptability/API, file formats, open source status, cost.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: None

## Steps
- [ ] Compile list of candidate 2D animation tools
- [ ] Research each tool: features, scripting/API, file formats, license, cost
- [ ] Compare against requirements (quality, scriptability, open source, one-time cost)
- [ ] Narrow to top 2-3 candidates for deeper evaluation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Comparison table of all evaluated tools
- [ ] Top 2-3 candidates identified with rationale
- [ ] Any deal-breakers documented

## Outcome (fill after Iterate)
- **Actual Time**:
