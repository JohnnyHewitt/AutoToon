# 1. Survey 2D Animation Tools

**Goal**: Identify and compare 2D animation tools (OpenToonz, Synfig, Pencil2D, Krita, Blender Grease Pencil, Toon Boom, Moho, etc.). Evaluate: quality, scriptability/API, file formats, open source status, cost.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: None

## Steps
- [x] Compile list of candidate 2D animation tools
- [x] Research each tool: features, scripting/API, file formats, license, cost
- [x] Compare against requirements (quality, scriptability, open source, one-time cost)
- [x] Narrow to top 2-3 candidates for deeper evaluation

## Definition of Done
- [x] Comparison table of all evaluated tools
- [x] Top 2-3 candidates identified with rationale
- [x] Any deal-breakers documented

## Outcome
- **Actual Time**: ~1 session
- **Result**: **Blender Grease Pencil selected.** Best Python API depth, free, open source (GPL-3.0), active development, 2D/3D hybrid capability. Toon Boom Harmony and Moho Pro were strong runners-up but closed source. TVPaint eliminated (too organic/frame-by-frame, pytvpaint incompatible with v12). Pencil2D, CACANi, Synfig, Krita eliminated (no viable scripting for automation).
- **Follow-ups**: Intent 02 — deep-dive Blender's Python API for GP specifically
