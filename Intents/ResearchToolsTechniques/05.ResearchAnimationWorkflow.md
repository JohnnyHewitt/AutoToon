# 5. Research Animation Workflow

**Goal**: How 2D animation actually works in the chosen tool: rigging, tweening, lip sync, scene composition. What can be scripted vs. what needs manual work.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: 02

## Steps
- [ ] Research core 2D animation concepts: rigging, tweening, keyframes, lip sync
- [ ] Document how the top candidate tool handles each
- [ ] Identify which steps are scriptable/automatable
- [ ] Assess what remains manual and how to minimize it

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Animation workflow documented for chosen tool
- [ ] Scriptable vs. manual steps clearly mapped
- [ ] Lip sync and scene composition approaches identified

## Outcome (fill after Iterate)
