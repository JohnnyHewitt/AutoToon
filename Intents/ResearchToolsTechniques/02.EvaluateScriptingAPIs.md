# 2. Evaluate Scripting & APIs

**Goal**: Deep-dive on the top 2-3 tools from Intent 01. Document their scripting languages, API surface, automation capabilities, and feasibility of 100% AI control.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: 01

## Steps
- [ ] For each top candidate, research scripting language and API docs
- [ ] Document what can be automated vs. what requires manual interaction
- [ ] Assess feasibility of full AI control for each tool
- [ ] Identify gaps or limitations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Scripting/API capabilities documented for each candidate
- [ ] Automation coverage assessment (what % of workflow is scriptable)
- [ ] Clear ranking by AI-controllability

## Outcome (fill after Iterate)
- **Actual Time**:
- **Result**:
