# 2. Evaluate Scripting & APIs

**Goal**: Deep-dive on the top 2-3 tools from Intent 01. Document their scripting languages, API surface, automation capabilities, and feasibility of 100% AI control.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: 01

## Steps
- [x] For each top candidate, research scripting language and API docs
- [x] Document what can be automated vs. what requires manual interaction
- [x] Assess feasibility of full AI control for each tool
- [x] Identify gaps or limitations

## Definition of Done
- [x] Scripting/API capabilities documented for each candidate
- [x] Automation coverage assessment (what % of workflow is scriptable)
- [x] Clear ranking by AI-controllability

## Outcome
- **Actual Time**: Resolved during Intent 01
- **Result**: Blender GP selected in Intent 01 specifically for having the deepest Python API (`bpy.types.GreasePencil` — layers, frames, strokes, points all accessible). Full ranking documented in Research/ToolSurvey.md scripting table. Blender ranked #1 for AI-controllability.
- **Follow-ups**: Detailed Blender GP API mapping will happen during Intent 05 (Animation Workflow) and Intent 07 (MCP Feasibility) where we need to know exact API surface.
