# 7. Evaluate MCP Feasibility

**Goal**: Can the top tool(s) be wrapped via MCP? What would the architecture look like? Identify gaps and required adapters.
**Est.**: ≤2 hours
**Dependencies**: 02

## Steps
- [ ] Review MCP architecture and capabilities
- [ ] Map the chosen tool's API/scripting to potential MCP tools
- [ ] Identify gaps where adapters or middleware would be needed
- [ ] Sketch a high-level architecture for AI → MCP → animation tool

## Definition of Done
- [ ] MCP feasibility assessment complete
- [ ] Architecture sketch documented
- [ ] Gaps and required adapters identified

## Outcome (fill after Iterate)
- **Actual Time**:
- **Result**:
